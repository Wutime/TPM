made the banner icon a style property (defaults to @fa-var-trophy)
made the sidebar icon a style property (defaults to @fa-var-trophy)
added phrase for tpm_banner_text for "Top Monthly Poster" to prevent wrap on small screens

fixed compact layout template to properly render "no results found"
fixed all js errors (previous version had constant client-side JS errors in XF 2.3.x)
